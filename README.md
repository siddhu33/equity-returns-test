## Overview (Generated with ChatGPT)

This script retrieves historical stock price data for companies listed on the NASDAQ, processes the data to calculate normalized returns, and saves the results in a parquet file. It utilizes the `yahooquery` library for data fetching, `polars` for data manipulation, and `pandas` for date handling. The script is structured to handle data in batches and employs multithreading for efficiency.

## Key Components

1. **Imports and Constants**:

   - The script imports necessary libraries such as `yahooquery`, `datetime`, `polars`, `pandas`, and others.
   - A constant `BATCH_SIZE` is defined to manage the number of stock symbols processed simultaneously.

2. **Loading Price Data**:

   - **`_load_price_data(batch)`**:
     - Takes a batch of stock symbols as input.
     - Retrieves historical price data for each symbol using `yahooquery`.
     - Cleans up the data, ensuring the 'date' column is in datetime format.
     - Prints a message indicating that the price data for the batch has been loaded.
     - Returns the processed price data.

3. **Loading Prices from NASDAQ**:

   - **`load_prices()`**:
     - Reads NASDAQ-traded stock symbols from a CSV file (`nasdaqtraded.txt`).
     - Filters symbols to only include those that are actively traded.
     - Splits the symbols into batches and uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to fetch price data concurrently.
     - Concatenates the fetched data into a single DataFrame.
     - Writes the resulting data to a parquet file (`prices.parquet`).

4. **Getting Prices**:

   - **`get_prices()`**:
     - Checks if the parquet file (`prices.parquet`) exists.
     - If not, it calls `load_prices()` to fetch and save the data.
     - Returns a lazy-loaded DataFrame of the price data from the parquet file.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - **`main()`**:
     - Calls `get_prices()` to obtain the price data.
     - Calculates the minimum and maximum date for each symbol to create an effective date range.
     - Explodes the effective date range into individual dates.
     - Joins the price data with effective dates to obtain the end price for each date.
     - Performs another join to get the start price for the previous date.
     - Computes the normalized return for each symbol based on the start and end prices.
     - Sorts the data by symbol and effective date.
     - Computes cumulative normalized returns by grouping the data.
     - Writes the final result to a parquet file (`returns.parquet`).

## Conclusion

This script efficiently gathers and processes historical stock price data for NASDAQ-listed companies, calculating normalized and cumulative returns, which can be valuable for investment analysis and strategy development. The use of batching and multithreading enhances its performance, making it suitable for handling large datasets.
